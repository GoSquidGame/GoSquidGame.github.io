  tabs_2_content_3: `We want to provide a suitable technical environment and community fund for development teams that want to provide applications such as games, Gamified DeFi, Community, and Commerce, which are components of the Squid Game Metaverse.`,
  tabs_2_content_4: `New projects are discovered and financially supported based on the community to create a decentralized game ecosystem`,
  tabs_2_content_5: `It not only distributes all economic resources fairly, but also ensures long-term dispersion and balance.`,
  tabs_2_content_6: `The consonants of ‘Hangul’, invented to express all sounds, are used as the symbol system for the building blocks of the metaverse.`,
  tabs_2_content_7: `It provides various modular building blocks for developing secure and flexible decentralized games and services, and Metaverse UX.`,

  tabs_2_content_21: `LEEDO is the currency used in the Squid Game Card Metaverse and supports the ERC20 standard. 700,000,000 of this currency will be issued for Season 0, and 300,000,000 for Season 1 will be issued. Additional issuance may be issued by the decision of the DAO to be formed in the future.`,

  tabs_2_content_30: `<b>2. LEEDO Token Allocation</b>`,
  tabs_2_content_31: `Distribution of LEEDO to be issued is as follows: Some of these will become claimable according to the payment schedule once individual cards are checked into the Metaverse, and will be issued at the time of the user's claim. However, DAO-controlled funds exist in the DAO’s ‘budget’ status with ‘issuable’ status and will not be issued unless the DAO executes them. Therefore, the final issuance of Season 0 may be less than 700,000,000.`,
  tabs_2_content_32: `One of the important features of the Squid Game Card project's ERC20 distribution plan is that development team rewards are not allocated separately. The way the development team can acquire LEEDO is to check in at the 'check-in counter' like other holders, using the minted NFT among the NFTs allocated in the 21st round, and receive 'Migration Settlement Aid’ and 'Basic Income' `,
  tabs_2_content_33: `However, the LEEDO token, which will be used as expenses for the project for the next 2-3 months, which will be required for the development of the DAO contract and the composition of the DAO, is temporarily controlled by the development team, and the expenditure record will be completely on the blockchain. The remaining budget goes to the fund controlled by the DAO once the DAO is formed.`,

  tabs_5_content_4: `When you mint or purchase this card, it means that you are invited to the Squid Game Metaverse ecosystem.`,
  tabs_5_content_5: `What do the 'Korean consonants' and 8 number attributes on the squid game card mean?`,
  tabs_5_content_6: `It has no predefined meaning. It can be used in various meanings depending on the creative interpretation of the game's developers and users.`,
  tabs_5_content_7: `It is intentionally designed not to give any meaning to the attributes in order to promote endless creative imagination.`,
  tabs_5_content_8: `How can I get the ‘Squid Game Card’?`,
  tabs_5_content_9: `You can participate in the 20 rounds of Free Minting Round and pay the gas fee and mint it on [Free Minting] menu or the web3 page of the squid game card smart contract for free.`,
  tabs_5_content_10: `Users who are willing to buy the ‘Squid Game Card’ can obtain it by purchasing a card in OpenSea(https://opensea.io/collection/squid-game-card-nft).`,
  tabs_5_content_11: `Can I still issue squid game cards for free?`,

  tabs_5_content_15: `No! Only one squid game card can be minted at a time on [Free Minting] menu or Etherscan's squid game smart contract web3 page. There is no limit to the number of cards that one person can mint.`,

  tabs_5_content_17: `Since the Squid Game Card NFT is registered on the OpenSea Marketplace, you can check the minted or purchased Squid Game card in the [Profile] menu of your account by connecting the wallet such as the metamask used for issuing it to the OpenSea site.`,
  tabs_5_content_18: `Where is the 'Squid Game Card' used?`,
  tabs_5_content_19: `In the Squid Metaverse, use with an 'invitation ticket' for dApps that require 'specific card possession' as a condition of participation, or`,
  tabs_5_content_20: `It can be combined with other smart contracts to transform or transform it into an 'item for a specific purpose', or`,
  tabs_5_content_21: `It will be used to exchange tokens owned by other users within the Squid Metaverse.`,
  tabs_5_content_22: `Can I create a game or community with the 'Squid Game Card'?`,
  tabs_5_content_23: `Of course. For users who have 'Squid Game Card', you can create your own game or community application by independently assigning qualitative characteristics to the attributes assigned to 'Korean consonants' and 'numbers' of the 'Squid Game Card'.`,
  tabs_5_content_24: `If only 9,576 are minted, isn't it difficult for most people to have a squid game card?`,

  tabs_5_content_27: `Are the 11 attributes given to the squid game card enough?`,
  tabs_5_content_28: `11 attributes are enough to form a variety of combinations, but if more attributes are needed, new attributes can be added using the base seed (gene information) included in each NFT card.`,
  tabs_5_content_29: `How is the value of the Squid Game Card determined?`,
  tabs_5_content_30: `The value of the Squid Game card is not inherent in itself, but is given by the game or community created using this card.`,
  tabs_5_content_31: `However, since some attributes given to the squid game card are issued with their ‘rarity’ adjusted during the issuance stage, the frequency of attribute expression can be a factor that fundamentally affects value formation.`,
  tabs_5_content_32: `Oops. It's a surprise! I’m really frustrated at the huge gas fee to claim a card`,
  tabs_5_content_33: `One of the reasons why Etherscan shows abnormally high gas fees is that new cards cannot be claimed at that time (we call it ‘round break’).`,

  tabs_5_content_37: `If I draw a ‘○○○’ or a ‘ㄱㄱㄱ’ card, can I win 5 ETH prize?`,
  tabs_5_content_38: `No. A card is randomly selected out of 456 cards in each round and if the card has same three consonants, such as ‘○○○’ and also there has been no 5 ETH prize winner by this time then its hodler can receive 5 ETH prize.`,
  tabs_5_content_39: `If 5 ETH prize awarded before, the hodler receives 1 ETH prize.`,

  tabs_7_content_3: `‘Migrant Settlement Aid (NFT Holder One Time Bonus)’ and ‘Basic Income (Staking Rewards)’ are paid only for the checked-in card`,
  tabs_7_content_4: `The amount of 'Migration Settlement Aid' allocated to the checked-in card depends on calculation using the card's 'characteristic' (a combination of 3 Hangul consonants + 8 numbers), the issued order (within 10, within 100, within 1,000), and the order of claims.`,
  tabs_7_content_5: `The amount of 'Basic Income' will be paid about 34 LEEDO tokens daily for all cards (which may change according to the change in the Ethereum block cycle. To be precise, 0.00511409803 LEEDO per block per card), regardless of card attributes, issuance order, or check-in order. The same amount will be paid during the check-in period. If you check-in first, you will receive more rewards than others who haven't checked in yet.`,
  tabs_7_content_6: `Allocated LEEDO tokens will be paid by the claim of the card holder. (Gas fee is paid by oneself)`,
  tabs_7_content_7: `If you check out cards or check in a new card, the LEEDO allocated up to that time will be paid`,

  tabs_7_content_11: `<b>geneSSum</b>`,
  tabs_7_content_12: `geneSSum is according to the 8-digit trait assigned to each card, and is calculated by the ‘sum of squares of each number’. For example, if the 8-digit is 1234 5678, (1)^2 + (2)^2 + (3)^2 + (4)^2 + (5)^2 + (6)^2 + (7)^2 + ( 8)^2 = 204. However, if geneSSum is less than 100, 100 is applied.`,
  tabs_7_content_13: `<b>tokenIdFactor</b>`,
  tabs_7_content_14: `The tokenIdFactor provides an incentive to the card issued earlier since tokenId reflects the issuance order. If the tokenId is less than 100, apply 200, if it is more than 1,000, use 100, and if it is greater than 100 and less than 1,000, 150 is applied.`,
  tabs_7_content_15: `<b>consFactor</b>`,
  tabs_7_content_16: `consFactor is based on the combination of 3 Hangul consonants of each token. 'ㅇ△ㅁ' card is 2. All the same consonants of 'ㅇ', '△', 'ㅁ' card is 5, Cards containing two of the same 'ㅇ', '△', and 'ㅁ' are applied as 3, and 1 is applied for other cards.`,
  tabs_7_content_17: `<b>timeFactor</b>`,
  tabs_7_content_18: `timeFactor is according to the check-in order, and 250 is given to the 1st place, 100 is given to the 9,576th. In between, a linear function is applied to reduce it linearly.`,

  tabs_7_content_21: `Basic income is allocated approximately 34 per card per day during the check-in period. (Exactly 0.00511409803 LEEDO per block per card)`,
  tabs_7_content_22: `The payment of basic income will be paid to the holder's wallet address upon claim of the LEEDO token by the holder or a change in the number of checked-in cards (check-in or check-out of some or all cards)`,

  tabs_2_content_32: `Squid Game Card 프로젝트의 ERC20 분배 계획의 중요한 특징 중 하나는, 개발팀 리워드가 따로 할당되지 않는다는 점입니다. 개발팀이 LEEDO를 획득할 수 있는 방법은, 21 라운드에 배정받은 NFT 중 민팅한 NFT를 이용하여, 다른 홀더들과 마찬가지로 ‘체크인 카운터’에 체크인하여 ‘이주 정착지원금’과 ‘기본 소득’을 받는 것 외에는 허용되지 않습니다.`,
  tabs_2_content_33: `다만, DAO 컨트랙의 개발과 DAO의 구성 등에 소요될 약 2~3개월의 시간 동안 프로젝트를 위해 사용될 비용으로 쓰기 위한 LEEDO 토큰은 일시적으로 개발팀이 통제하여 지출되며 그 지출 기록은 완전하게 블록체인 상에 공개됩니다. 남은 예산은 DAO가 구성되면 DAO가 통제하는 펀드로 귀속됩니다.`,
